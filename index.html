      <h2> <strong>What is the Problem? The Story. </strong> </h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Universal Design website! This is a website where every individual’s right to access and navigate digital content is championed.
        In fact, the <a href = "https://www.internetsociety.org/news/speeches/2011/the-internet-is-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet</a> 
        was founded on accessibility. Internet pioneer Vint Cerf has hearing loss and was therefore very aware that it should be a vital part of the Internet.

        <summary>Who's affected?</summary>
        <p>
          Disabilities can impact someone from fully accessing web pages and apps. These can vary widely. We have sensory, physical, cognitive, and psychiatric disabilities. Physical mobility impairments can make it hard to navigate links and interfaces.
          Visual impairments can make it difficult to see content. They must use screen readers and alt text in images certainly helps. 
          Those with cognitive disabilities need a clear layout, “get to the point” sentences, and easy navigation. People with deafness will need captions or transcripts in videos. It is important to accommodate these wide ranging disabilities, allowing everyone to engage content effectively.

      <summary>Goals. Why should you care?</summary>
      <p>
        As you browse through this website, you will not only gain insights into the basic principles and objectives of Universal Design but also discover the impact of accessibility on the lives of individuals worldwide. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Many web developers don’t seem to care about making the website accessible for all people. As a result, people’s browsing experience on websites is often hindered. It is unknown why many web developers neglect to implement accessibility practices. Is it because there aren’t enough resources? Or is it because there is a lack of awareness?  
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal of this website is to ensure we advocate for those with disabilities, to not leave them behind. Of course this will take time, but we will get there as long as we work together. Everything is possible if we work together. By being kind hearted, you are not only removing barriers from someone, you are affirming the worth of each individual and showing empathy for their situation. In addition, it just makes good business sense to reach all customers.

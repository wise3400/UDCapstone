      <h2><b> What Exactly is Universal Design? </b></h2>
      
      <p>"<b>Universal Design </b> is founded on the view that there is a wide spectrum of human abilities and that an individual’s abilities change over time and in different situations. This course takes the view that disability vs. ability (or able-bodied) is not a binary, dividing the disabled from the non-disabled. Ability is a spectrum and all of us have different levels of functional ability (and disability) in different situations and at different points of our life." - ATLS 3150</p>

      <h2> <b> 6 Important </b> <a href = "http://www.csun.edu/science/courses/671/bibliography/preece.html">  <b> Norman Concepts to Consider </b>  </a> </h2>
      
      <p>When considering building an accessible website, we should consider these Normal Concepts: </p>

      <br>
      
      <h3> <b> ONE: Visibility </b> </h3>
      <br>
      <p>The more visible functions are, the more likely users will be able to know what to do next. Incontrast, when functions are "out of sight," it makes them more difficult to find and know how to use.</p>
      
      <br>

      <h3> <b>TWO: Feedback </b></h3>
      <br>
      <p>Feedback is about sending back information about what action has been done and what has been accomplished, allowing the person to continue with the activity. Various kinds of feedback are available for interaction design-audio, tactile, verbal, and combinations of these.</p>

      <br> 
      <h3> <b> THREE: Constraints </b></h3>
      <br>
      <p> The design concept of constraining refers to determining ways of restricting the kind of user interaction that can take place at a given moment. There are various ways this can be achieved.</p>

      <br>
      <h3><b> FOUR: Mapping </b></h3>
      <br>
      <p>This refers to the relationship between controls and their effects in the world. Nearly all artifacts need some kind of mapping between controls and effects, whether it is a flashlight, car, power plant, or cockpit. An example of a good mapping between control and effect is the up and down arrows used to represent the up and down movement of the cursor, respectively, on a computer keyboard.</p>
      <br>
      <h3><b> FIVE: Consistency </b></h3>
      <br>
      <p>This refers to designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks. In particular, a consistent interface is one that follows rules, such as using the same operation to select all objects. For example, a consistent operation is using the same input action to highlight any graphical object at the interface, such as always clicking the left mouse button. Inconsistent interfaces, on the other hand, allow exceptions to a rule.</p>
      <br>
      <h3><b> SIX: Affordance </b></h3>
      <br>
      <p>Is a term used to refer to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it. For example, a mouse button invites pushing (in so doing acting clicking) by the way it is physically constrained in its plastic shell. At a very simple level, to afford means "to give a clue" (Norman, 1988). When the affordances of a physical object are perceptually obvious it is easy to know how to interact with it.</p>

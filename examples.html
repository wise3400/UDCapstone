      <h2> <strong>Not too shabby.. but still okay - <a href = "https://www.honolulu.hawaii.edu/facdev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Honolulu Community College</a> </strong> </h2>
      <p>Let's take a look at a good accessible website.</p>
      <img src = "img/honolulu.png" alt = "a snapshot of the honolulu community college website">
      
      <p>This looks more modern! Let's check WAVE.</p>
      <img src = "img/honolulu_WAVE.png" alt = "a snapshot of the honolulu community college website using WAVE">
      <p>So far so good. Good contrast, no errors, and a bunch of <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARIAs.</a> Yay!</p>
      
      <h3><strong>Mobile View</strong></h3>
      <img src = "img/honolulu_mobile.png" alt = "a snapshot of the honolulu community college website in mobile view">
      <p>Not too shabby here. The only problem is the navigation menu. Nobody could get to the other pages. And that is a problem.</p>

      <h3><strong>Lighthouse</strong></h3>
      <img src = "img/honolulu_lighthouse.png" alt = "a snapshot of the honolulu community college website using lighthouse tool">
      <p>
        Ohh.. didn't expect this one to be average. At least we have an "A" on the accessibility section. 
        The score is okay for the SEO and best practices. Creators for this website should do more about
        the performance of the site! Don't just stop there!
      </p>
      <h3><strong>Validator</strong></h3>
      <img src = "img/honolulu_validator.png" alt = "a snapshot of the honolulu community college website using the validator">
      <p>
        Yikes. We have 10+ silly syntax errors. It's better than 100+ errors at least. But, these errors are easy to fix. 
        Not sure why this creator of the website didn't even attempt to check the validator. Come on. You can do better!
      </p>
      
      <h3><strong>Outliner</strong></h3>
      <img src = "img/honolulu_outliner.png" alt = "a snapshot of the honolulu community college website using the outliner tool">

      <p>
        Uh oh. We have 2 "untitled elements". This is no good for the screen reader and for the blind! 
        It's going to be unclear to the blind. I am warning ya. Slap those headers with names at least!
        Don't slack!
      </p>
      
      <h3><strong>Ending on a good note - AChecker tool</strong></h3>
      <img src = "img/honolulu_achecker.png" alt = "a snapshot of the honolulu community college website using the Achecker tool">
      <p>Yeehaw! Now this is just excellent. No guidelines and laws have been broken. This website will likely be viewed more. Congratulations!</p>





      <h2> <strong>Terrible. Just terrible. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. -  <a href = "https://skepticalscience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skeptical Science</a></strong> </h2>
      <p>Let's check out Skeptical Science, a terrible website.</p>
      <img src = "img/skeptical_science.png" alt = "snapshot of skeptical science website">
      
      <p>Looks like something out of the fricking 90s. Let's check WAVE.</p>
      <img src = "img/WAVE_skeptical.png" alt = "snapshot of skeptical science being tested by WAVE">

      <p>
        HOLY CRAP. What is going on here?! This is totally unacceptable with the 35 contrast errors and 91 errors 
        including the missing alt texts in images. Please always check WAVE before you publish websites! Check out 
        the "details" tab for more information!
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        <strong>Mobile view</strong>
      </h3>
      <img src = "img/skeptical_mobile.png" alt = "snapshot of mobile view for skeptical science">
      <p>
        Well, if this website were a person, its mobile view mode would be in need of a serious makeover! It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. Media queries are the fashion police this site desperately needs to call for some style advice!
      </p>
      
      <h3><strong>Lighthouse</strong></h3>
      <img src ="img/skeptical_lighthouse.png" alt = "snapshot of the lighthouse tool used on skeptical science">
      <p>
        Oh boy. It's an "F". Poor performance, poor accessibility, and did not use best practices.
        Take a look at the SEO. That is not the number you want. Your business will not gain traction if 
        that were to happen. Be aware.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>AChecker tool</strong></h3>
      <img src = "img/aChecker_skeptical.png" alt = "snapshot of the AChecker tool used on skeptical science">
      <p>
        How on Earth is this web developer not compliant by testing? The ridiculous about of violations shown is just..
        disgusting. This website definitely does not comply with the American with Disabilities Act. And therefore,
        the people who made this website deserves to be thrown in jail. They're disrespecting the disability community.
      </p>
      
      <h3><strong>Validator</strong></h3>
      <img src = "img/validator_skeptical.png" alt = "snapshot of the validator tool used on skeptical science">
      <p>
        Wow wow wow. Shake your head right now. 100+ syntax errors on the validator. Right after you are done with a page, 
        put your file into the validator and double check so you don't get numerous spam errors at the end.
      </p>
      
      <h3><strong>Ending on a good note -- the outliner</strong></h3>
      <img src ="img/skeptical_outliner.png" alt = "snapshot of the outliner tool used on skeptical science">
      <p>
        Finally. Finally, we end on a good note. Elements are properly named and listed! At least there are 
        no "untitled elements". Whew... 
        Although, it is not good practice to name an element twice. They named "Term Lookup" twice. The screen reader and the user will get confused!

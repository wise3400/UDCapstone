      <h2> <b>Oh YEA! Now, that's good.. </b> </h2>
      <p>Test</p>

      <h2> <b>Bad bad bad... tsk. tsk. tsk. -  <a href = "https://skepticalscience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skeptical Science</a></b> </h2>
      <p>Let's check out Skeptical Science.</p>
      <img src = "img/skeptical_science.png" alt = "snapshot of skeptical science website">
      
      <p>Looks like something out of the fricking 90s. Let's check WAVE.</p>
      <img src = "img/WAVE_skeptical.png" alt = "snapshot of skeptical science being tested by WAVE">

      <p>
        HOLY CRAP. What is going on here?! This is totally unacceptable with the 35 contrast errors and 91 errors 
        including the missing alt texts in images. Please always check WAVE before you publish websites! Check out 
        the "details" tab for more information!
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        <strong>Mobile view</strong>
      </h3>
      <img src = "img/skeptical_mobile.png" alt = "snapshot of mobile view for skeptical science">
      <p>
        Well, if this website were a person, its mobile view mode would be in need of a serious makeover! It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. Media queries are the fashion police this site desperately needs to call for some style advice!
      </p>
      
      <h3><strong>Lighthouse</strong></h3>
      <img src ="img/skeptical_lighthouse.png" alt = "snapshot of the lighthouse tool used on skeptical science">
      <p>
        Oh boy. It's an F. Poor performance, poor accessibility, and did not use best practices.
        Take a look at the SEO. That is not the number you want. Your business will not gain traction if 
        that were to happen. Be aware.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>AChecker tool</strong></h3>
      <img src = "img/aChecker_skeptical.png" alt = "snapshot of the AChecker tool used on skeptical science">
      <p>
        How on Earth is this web developer not get sued? The ridiculous about of violations shown is just..
        disgusting. This website definitely does not comply with the American with Disabilities Act. And therefore,
        the people who made this website deserves to be thrown in jail. They're disrespecting the disability community.
      </p>
      
      <h3><strong>Validator</strong></h3>
      <img src = "img/validator_skeptical.png" alt = "snapshot of the validator tool used on skeptical science">
      <p>
        Wow wow wow. Shake your head right now. 100+ syntax errors on the validator. Right after you are done with a page, 
        put your file into the validator and double check so you don't get numerous spam errors at the end.
      </p>
      
      <h3><strong>Ending on a good note -- the outliner</strong></h3>
      <img src ="img/skeptical_outliner.png" alt = "snapshot of the outliner tool used on skeptical science">
      <p>
        Finally. Finally, we end on a good note. Elements are properly named and listed! At least there are 
        no "untitled elements". Whew... 
        Although, it is not good practice to name an element twice. They named "Term Lookup" twice.

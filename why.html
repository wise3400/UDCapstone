      <h2><b> Why Apply Universal Design to Websites? </b></h2>
      
      <p>
        Applying Universal Design to websites is to ensure equal access,
        improvements in user experience, and meeting legal requirements. By making websites accessible to all users,
        including those with different types of disabilities, Universal Design undoubtedly promotes inclusiveness 
        and ensures that everyone can access information and services online. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        When we encounter this approach, it is certain that it will enhance the overall user experience. 
        Not by one individual who has a disability, but to all users. This is all done by making the website 
        more intuitive, user-friendly, and mobile first meaning it will work on different types of devices (e.g. tablets, phones, laptops).
        When we have designed an accessible website, it often performs better in search engines. This will benefit all types of businesses 
        by expanding and reaching out to customers. For sure, this will improve customer satisfaction. 
        To sum up, the main purpose of Universal Design is to accommodate diverse user needs and just simply give all people equal access.

      <h2><b>Accessibility for Everyone</b></h2>
      <p>
        Universal Design stresses to make environments, products, and services usuable by individuals with
        diverse abilities. This includes disabilities, elderlies, and individuals with permanent and 
        temporary impairments. By applying human-centered design which is considering a wide range of user 
        needs and preferences, Universal Design enhances accessibility and promotes independence. 
      </p>
     
      <h2><b>Accessibility Standards and Guidelines</b></h2>
      <p>
         <a href = "https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" >Web Content Accessibility Guidelines </a> or known as WCAG developed by 
         the World Wide Web Consoritum (W3C), provide sets of recommendations for creating accessible web content. 
         Guidelines will cover aspects such as providing alternative text for images, smooth keyboard navigation, and maintaining 
         good color contrast. They align closely with Universal Design principles and focuses attention on the creation of universally 
         accessible digital experiences.

      <h2><b>Far Better User Experience</b></h2>
      <p>
        Yes. Universal Design enhances user experiences for everyone by a lot. 
        Web developers must priortize simplicity, clarity, and flexibility in design.
        Universal Design improves simply improves usability and satisfaction for all 
        users. This will lead to better outcomes and increases engagement. People won't 
        be bored!
      </p>
      <h2><b>Don't Break the Law</b></h2>
      <p>
        You must abide by the law. Universal Design is lead by legal requirements and 
        ethical principles aimed to promote accessibility and nondiscrimination. 
        The United States Congress has passed the American with Disabilities Act or ADA
        which is a legislation that mandates accessibility standards in public
        accomodations. The United Nations has also developed a "Convention on the Rights of
        Persons with Disabilities" which is an international human rights treaty that adocates
        for the rights of individuals with disabilities.

        Many big companies are getting swamped with lawsuits and this is on the rise. Lawsuits involving the blind and deaf
        are the most concerning cases of all time. Read more about it <a href = "https://www.whoisaccessible.com/guidelines/largest-web-accessibility-lawsuits/#web-accessibility-lawsuits-trend"> here. </a>

        <h2><b>Summary</b></h2>
        <p>
          To have on-going improvement, developers must embrace user feedback through iteration of human-centered design 
          and developing technologies. The concept is to both encourage designers and developers to remain on high alert in 
          addressing accessibility issues and seek creative solutions to enhance inclusiveness. 

          <br>
          <br>

          The key to success is by applying principles of universal design and standards / guidelines such as 
          WCAG and the law. By doing this, organizations, businesses, services, etc. can create an environment 
          that is user-friendly, accessible, useful, and most importantly to welcome to all people.

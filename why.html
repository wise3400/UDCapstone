      <h2><b> Why Apply Universal Design to Websites? </b></h2>
      
      <p>
        The purpose of employing Universal Design to websites is to ensure equal access, improve the user experience, and to meet all applicable legal requirements. 
        By making websites accessible to all users, including those with different types of disabilities, 
        Universal Design undoubtedly promotes inclusiveness and ensures that everyone can access information and services online.

      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        When we deploy this approach, it will establish the enhancement of the overall user experience. 
        Not only will this benefit just one individual who may have a disability, but for all users. 
        The universal design concept will serve as a backbone for the website so it is more intuitive, user-friendly and mobile first 
        (e.g., it will work on different types of devices such as tablets, phones, laptops).  
        When developing the website, considerations need to be made for optimal search performance.  
        This will benefit all types of businesses by expanding ease of use when engaging potential consumers, all with the goal of customer satisfaction improvement. 
        To summarize, the main purpose of Universal Design is to accommodate diverse user needs and provide all end users with equal accessibility.

      <h2><b>Accessibility for Everyone</b></h2>
      <p>
        Universal Design stresses to make environments, products, and services usable by individuals with diverse abilities. 
        This includes disabilities, elderly, and individuals with permanent and temporary impairments.  
        By applying human-centered design, a wide range of user needs and preferences are strongly considered.  
        As a result, Universal Design enhances accessibility and promotes independence to a wider range of the end-user population.

      <h2><b>Accessibility Standards and Guidelines</b></h2>
      <p>
         <a href = "https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" >Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> known as WCAG developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), 
         provide recommendations for creating accessible web content. Guidelines will cover aspects such as providing alternative text for images, 
         smooth keyboard navigation, and maintaining enhanced color contrast. 
         The guidelines align closely with Universal Design principles and focus attention on the creation of universally accessible digital experiences.

      <h2><b>Far Better User Experience</b></h2>
      <p>
        Universal Design significantly enhances user experiences for everyone.  Web developers must prioritize simplicity, clarity, and flexibility in design. 
        Universal Design improves usability and satisfaction for all end users. This will lead to better outcomes and increased engagement. 
        People will not be bored!

      <section>
      <h2><b>Don't Break the Law</b></h2>
      <p>
        You must abide by all legal legislation. When employing the universal design concept, it must follow all legal requirements and ethical principles aimed to promote accessibility and nondiscrimination. 
        In 1990, the United States Congress passed the American with Disabilities Act or ADA.  This legislation mandates accessibility standards to accommodate the disabled segment of the population. 
        The United Nations also developed a "Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities'' which is an international human rights treaty that advocates for the rights of individuals with disabilities.

        Many big companies are getting inundated with lawsuits and continue to be on the rise. Lawsuits involving the blind and deaf are the most concerning cases at this time.

        <h2><b>Summary</b></h2>
        <p>
          To obtain on-going improvement, developers must embrace user feedback through iteration of human-centered design and developing technologies. 
          The concept is to both encourage designers and developers to remain on high alert in addressing accessibility issues and seek creative solutions to 
          enhance inclusiveness.

          <p>
          The key to success is to apply principles of universal design and standards / guidelines such as WCAG and related legislation. By doing this, organizations, businesses, services, etc. can create an environment that is user-friendly, accessible, 
          useful, and most importantly - welcoming to all people.

      <h2><b> What's Important About Universal Design? </b></h2>
      
      <p>Well... it's very important. This is because we need to make all websites accessible.
         So that <b> EVERYONE </b> and <b> ANYONE </b> can access the pages no matter their disabilities
         and abilities. Universal Design increases peoples' usability, safety, health, environments, etc.
         Overall, the main purpose of Universal Design is to give all people equal access in web pages.

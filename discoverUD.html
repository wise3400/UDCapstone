      <h2><b> Definition of Universal Design </b></h2>
      <p>
        Universal Design is an approach to designing or creating products, and environments that are accessible to all people of all ages, abilities, and disabilities. 
        The goal is to make products and services inclusive and free from barriers, so everyone can use them without needing assistance or adjustments.

      <h2><b>Laws & Regulations</b></h2>
      <p>
        Many countries have already passed legislation mandating the need for accessibility practices. Some examples include the Americans with Disabilities Act in the US; 
        the Equality Act 2010 in the United Kingdom; and, Services and Supports to Promote the Social Inclusion of Persons with Developmental Disabilities Act, 2008 in Canada. 
        These laws mandate businesses, organizations, and governments to make their products and services accessible to people with disabilities.

      <h2><b>Disabilities Worldwide</b></h2>
      <p>
        According to the <a href = "https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health">WHO</a> (World Health Organization), there are an estimated 1.3 billion people who experience significant disabilities. 
        As calculated, this represents 16% of the world's population.

      </p>
      
      <p>
        Types of disabilities include:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sensory disabilities: blindness, low vision, deafness</li>
          <li>Physical disabilities: paralysis, limb loss, muscular problems</li>
          <li>Cognitive disabilities: autism, dyslexia, or Down Syndrome</li>
          <li>Psychiatric disabilities: depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder</li>

      <h2><b>Norman Design Concepts</b></h2>
      <p>
        In addition to the seven principles, it is also very important to consider Norman's design concepts for digital content creation. 
        These can be websites or cell phone applications. These concepts  refer to principles created and introduced by Don Norman, a renowned usability expert.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Norman’s concepts are used when creating user-centered, intuitive, and effective designs for digital content. 
        On the left hand side of the page is an expandable list of key concepts that are commonly applied in digital design. 
        By embracing Norman’s concepts into digital content design, designers aim to create websites and interfaces that are not only functional, 
        but are user-friendly. This will allow positive interaction for many diverse groups of people.
      </p>

      <!-- <h2><b>Examples of Accessibility Problems</b></h2>
      <p>
        It is common to have accessibility issues such as images lacking alternative text,
        poor color contrast affecting legibility, and navigation structures that pose challenges
        for screen reader users. Recognizing and addressing these issues is crucial for creating
        universally accessible websites, services, and applications.

      <h2><b>Real Life Universal Design Examples</b></h2>

      <p>Universal Design can be applied in several areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Architecture - design structures that are accessible and provide convenience to everyone</li>
        <li>Technology - operating systems that provide intuitive and easy to navigate user interfaces</li>
        <li>Education - create inclusive learning environments that accommodate different types of learning styles</li>
        <li>Transportation - design accessible transportation systems for people with disabilities and the elderly</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><b>Human-Centered Design</b></h2>
      <p>
        Human-Centered Design stresses the importance of designing digital services or products with a deep understanding of the users' needs, preferences, and behaviors. 
        In web development, this method will ensure that interfaces are not only accessible but also align with user expectations so that it will result in a more 
        positive end-user experience.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Web developers will need to consider the diverse needs and abilities of the users; and, they must conduct user research, 
        create personas, and incorporate inclusive design practices. This will help ensure that websites, applications, 
        and services will provide the end-user with a wide range of user characteristics and preferences.

    <!-- Norman Concepts -->

    <h2> <b> Six Norman Design Concepts</b>  </h2>
   
    <details>
      <summary>Visibility </summary>
      
      <p>The more visible functions are, the more likely users will be able to know what to do next. Incontrast, when functions are "out of sight," it makes them more difficult to find and know how to use.  </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Feedback </summary>
      
      <p>Feedback is about sending back information about what action has been done and what has been accomplished, allowing the person to continue with the activity. Various kinds of feedback are available for interaction design-audio, tactile, verbal, and combinations of these.  </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Constraints </summary>
      
      <p>The design concept of constraining refers to determining ways of restricting the kind of user interaction that can take place at a given moment. There are various ways this can be achieved.  </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Mapping </summary>
      
      <p>This refers to the relationship between controls and their effects in the world. Nearly all artifacts need some kind of mapping between controls and effects, whether it is a flashlight, car, power plant, or cockpit. An example of a good mapping between control and effect is the up and down arrows used to represent the up and down movement of the cursor, respectively, on a computer keyboard.  </p>
    </details>


    <details>
      <summary>Consistency </summary>
      
      <p>This refers to designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks. In particular, a consistent interface is one that follows rules, such as using the same operation to select all objects. For example, a consistent operation is using the same input action to highlight any graphical object at the interface, such as always clicking the left mouse button. Inconsistent interfaces, on the other hand, allow exceptions to a rule.  </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Affordance </summary>
      
      <p>Is a term used to refer to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it. For example, a mouse button invites pushing (in so doing acting clicking) by the way it is physically constrained in its plastic shell. At a very simple level, to afford means "to give a clue" (Norman, 1988). When the affordances of a physical object are perceptually obvious it is easy to know how to interact with it.  </p>

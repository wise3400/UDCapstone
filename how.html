      <h2> <b>Legibility: Texts & Fonts </b> </h2>
      <p>
        Choosing fonts for your website could be really frustrating sometimes. It doesn't have to be that way!
        It is recommended that we want to stick with two basic fonts: sans-serif and serif. The question is: "which ones belong to which?"
        You should always consider using sans-serif for paragraphs and normal serif for all headers.
      </p>



      <p>
        <a href = "https://fonts.google.com/">Google fonts</a> is a excellent platform for exploring and experimenting with various typefaces. 
        Furthermore, it offers the convenience of generating CSS code to seamlessly import your selected fonts into your website.
        Additionally, it's crucial to ensure adequate line height in your paragraphs, as insufficient spacing could impede readability and diminish 
        user engagement with the content.
      </p>
      
      
      <h2><b>Choosing the Right Colors</b></h2>
      <p>
        Colors are important. Period. If you don't have good contrast, people will have migraines 
        when they're looking at your site. It is not recommended to use bright colors for the 
        background because it could hurt the eyes. <a href = "https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer">Adobe Color</a> is a great tool to check for contrast between your regular text 
        and your background. The tool will also tell you whether you have met the WCAG guidelines. More explanation here: <a href = "https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">Web AIM.</a>
      </p>
      
      <p>You could also use the color contrast checker that I made below!</p>
     
    
      <form id="colorContrastChecker">

          <label for="textColor">Text Color:</label>
          <input type="color" id="textColor" value="#000000">
          <br>
          <label for="background">Background Color:</label>
          <input type="color" id="background" value="#ffffff">
          <br>
          <br>
          <button type="button" onclick="checkContrast()">CHECK</button>
     
        </form>
        <!-- Displays results -->
        <div id="showData"></div>
      
      
      
      <h2><b>Screen Readers</b></h2>
      <p>
        Examples such as navigation elements are often intuitive and recognizable to sighted users,
        but not for those who are using screen readers. To address this discrepancy, creating 
        elements exclusively for screen readers can improve accessibility. Please see code 
        below for implementation.
      </p>

      <p>HTML Code:</p>
      <pre>
        
      <code> &lt;h2 class = "sr-only">Navigation &lt;/h2&gt; </code>
      
      </pre>

      <p>CSS Code:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          .sr-only 
          {
              border: 0;
              clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
              height: 1px;
              margin: -1px;
              overflow: hidden;
              padding: 0;
              position: absolute;
              white-space: nowrap;
              width: 1px;
              color: rgb(0,0,0);
              background-color: rgb(255,255,255);
            
          }
        </code>
      </pre>

      <h2><b>Alt Texts in Images</b></h2>
      <p>
        Ensuring the inclusion of alt text and captions for images is crucial. 
        It facilitates accessibility for all users, ensuring that everyone can comprehend the content regardless of their abilities.
        Alt text allows screen readers to convey image descriptions, enabling visually impaired individuals to understand the context. 
        Moreover, in cases where images fail to load on a website, alt text provides essential information about the image's content.
        Utilizing tools like the WAVE tool (linked below) can help detect any missing alt text, ensuring comprehensive accessibility standards are met.
      </p>

      <h2><b>Skip Navigation </b> </h2>
      <p>
        The skip navigation feature is commonly included in web design to further enhance 
        accessibility for people who rely on the keyboard navigation. By pressing the "tab" 
        key, the skip navigation link allows user to bypass the main navigation and 
        jumps directly to the main content of the page. This feature does in fact 
        save some time. Users don't have to go through the same set of links on every page. 
        To sum up, skip navigation is quick and easy for access to important content without
        getting stuck in the navigation menus.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the HTML part, you will need to place the following code below the body tag:
      </p>
      <p><code> &lt;a class = "skip-link" href = "#maincontent" &gt; Skip to main content/a&gt;</code></p>
     
      
      <p>
        Here's the CSS code on how to implement a skip navigation:
      </p>
      <pre> 
      <code>
        .skip-link 
        {
          background: black;
          color: #fff;
          font-weight: 700;
          padding: 4px;
          position: absolute;
          transform: translateY(-200%);
        }  
      
        .skip-link:focus {
            transform: translateY(0%);
        } 
    
        .skip-link {
            transition: transform 0.3s;
        }

      </code>
      </pre>
      
      <h2><b>HTML Validator</b></h2>
      <p>
        The <a href = "https://validator.w3.org/">HTML Validator</a> tool allows you to check for syntax errors in your HTML code as well as 
        assist with debugging. This tool also checks if you are abiding the standards set by W3C. 
        Examples of errors could include: missing tags, wrong attributes, illegal nesting of elements, etc. 
        Sometimes, the validator could give helpful suggestions on how to fix the errors. 
      </p>
      <img src = "img/Validator.png" alt = "an screenshot image of HTML validator tool " style = "width: 75%" class = "center">

      <h2><b>WAVE </b></h2>
      <p>
        <a href = "https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh?pli=1">WAVE</a> is a great tool for web developers seeking to make their websites accessible. The WAVE tool
        could recognize a lot of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines errors. Simple examples could be like: 
        contrast errors, HTML code errors, missing alt texts in images, etc. The tool will also provide a detail 
        description on how to tackle the issue.
      </p>
      <img src = "img/WAVE.png" alt = "an screenshot image of the WAVE tool " style = "width: 25%" class = "center">

      <h2><b>HTML Outliner</b></h2>
      <p>
        The <a href = "https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/html5-outliner/afoibpobokebhgfnknfndkgemglggomo">HTML Outliner</a> tool provides an overall structure of any HTML page. It simply examines 
        the HTML code and shows the hierarchy of headings and other structural elements such 
        as sections, navigation bar, footer, etc. It is good practice to have all elements
        properly named. Never have untitled elements on your website.
      </p>
      <img src = "img/Outliner.png" alt = "an screenshot image of the outliner tool " style = "width: 45%" class = "center">


      <h2><b>Responsive Website</b></h2>
      <p>
        Now that mobile usage has skyrocketed, it's crucial to ensure your website is responsive. Some users depend solely on smartphones to access websites, often due to constraints like limited mobility. 
        This can be achieved through the implementation of media queries, which assess the size of the user's device—whether it's a phone, tablet, or laptop—and adapt the layout accordingly. 
        For instance, this adaptation might involve transitioning from a traditional horizontal navigation bar to a vertical, thumb-friendly navigation layout.

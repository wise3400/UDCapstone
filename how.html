      <h2> <b>What Does the Adobe Contast Checker Do? </b> </h2>
      <p>Adobe Color is a tool that checks your color contrast. In other words, it checks if the color meets the WCAG standards. This tool also allows you to adjust the colors you chose so that the contrast ratio is at an okay mark. If the contrast ratio is good, then a green check mark will appear. </p>
      
      
      <h2><b>What Does the Nu HTML Checker Do?</b></h2>
      <p>This website checks if there are any errors or warnings in your HTML code. If there are errors or warnings, it will list it all out. It automatically locates where the errors or warnings are. I find this tool extremely helpful.</p>
     

      <h2><b>What Does the WAVE Evaluation Tool Do?</b></h2>
     <p>This is a Google Chrome Extension plugin. This tool checks errors you have, contrast errors, alerts, etc. This only works on a published site. </p>

      <h2><b>What Does the HTML5 Outliner Do?</b></h2>
      <p>This is also a Google Chrome Extension plugin. This tool generates a navigable page outline with headings and section elements. This tool also checks to see if you made any mistakes regarding unnamed headings, etc. </p>

      <h2><b>What is Google Fonts? </b> </h2>
      <p>Google Fonts is a website where you can choose your fonts. There are lots of fonts to choose from. Personally, I recommend 2 fonts in all web pages just because it is consistent.
      Make sure you choose fonts that are legible to read. </p>

      <h2><b> How To Create a Persona </b></h2>
      <p>Creating a persona will help you understand the users' needs, goals, experiences, etc. when designing a website or even a product.</p>
      <br>
      
      <p>
      First things first, let's start with something simple. Pretend that your persona is a real person. Create a bio about that person. You will need to include a name, a picture, and the age. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> 
      Second, write a description about that person. Keep in mind that you will need to include the person's background information such as their education, income, where they're from, occupation, etc.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> 
        Third, interview the person to find out what their goals and challenges are. Find out their personality traits.
